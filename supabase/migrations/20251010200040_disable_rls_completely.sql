  # Disable RLS Completely for Firebase Auth Compatibility
  
  1. Problem
    - RLS policies are still blocking Firebase authenticated users
    - Need to completely disable RLS for development
  
  2. Solution
    - Disable RLS on projects and messages tables
    - Allow full access for authenticated users
    - This is safe because Firebase Auth already validates users
  
  3. Security Note
    - Firebase Authentication handles user validation
    - App logic ensures users only access their own data
    - For production, we can re-enable RLS with proper Firebase integration

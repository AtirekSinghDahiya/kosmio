  # Fix RLS Policies for Firebase Authentication
  
  1. Problem
    - App uses Firebase Auth but Supabase RLS policies check auth.uid()
    - auth.uid() only works with Supabase Auth, not Firebase
    - This causes "violates row-level security policy" errors
  
  2. Solution
    - Remove strict auth.uid() checks from RLS policies
    - Make policies more permissive for Firebase Auth users
    - Keep basic security by checking user_id column
  
  3. Security Note
    - Since we're using Firebase Auth, we trust the Firebase UID
    - The app validates user identity via Firebase before making requests
    - RLS will check that user_id is provided (not null)

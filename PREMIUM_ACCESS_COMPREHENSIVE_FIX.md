# Premium Access Issue - Comprehensive Fix

## Problem Summary

Users with 10,000,000 tokens (displayed in UI) were unable to access premium AI models. All premium models remained locked despite having sufficient paid tokens in the database.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Authentication System Conflict**
- Application used BOTH Firebase Auth and Supabase Auth simultaneously
- Different components imported from different auth systems
- User IDs could mismatch between systems
- Cache and state management conflicts

### 2. **Multiple Conflicting Premium Check Services**
- `premiumAccessService.ts` - RPC function based
- `tierAccessService.ts` - Direct profile query with complex OR logic
- `simpleAccessCheck.ts` - Another query approach
- `directTierCheck.ts` - Yet another mechanism
- Each had different cache durations (5s, 30s) causing inconsistent states

### 3. **Database Flag Synchronization Failure**
- Users had `paid_tokens_balance = 10000000` in profiles
- But `is_premium`, `is_paid`, and `current_tier` flags were NOT set
- User records missing from `paid_tier_users` table
- Token purchases only updated balance, not premium flags

### 4. **Row Level Security (RLS) Complications**
- RLS policies using `auth.uid()` returned NULL for Firebase users
- Multiple migrations repeatedly toggling RLS on/off
- Queries failed silently due to RLS blocking legitimate access

### 5. **Model Lock Logic Based on Wrong Data**
- AIModelSelector locked models based on `isPremium` flag only
- Did not check actual token balance
- Even with 10M tokens, if flag was false, models stayed locked

### 6. **Trigger and Auto-Sync Failures**
- Triggers to sync tier tables weren't firing
- Token purchases bypassed trigger system
- Manual sync functions existed but never called

## Comprehensive Solution Implemented

### 1. Unified Premium Access Service

**File**: `src/lib/unifiedPremiumAccess.ts`

- Single source of truth for premium status
- Uses Firebase Auth exclusively (consistent with main app)
- 10-second cache to balance performance and freshness
- Automatically fixes premium flags when tokens detected
- Syncs to `paid_tier_users` table automatically

**Key Features**:
```typescript
// Checks paid_tokens_balance as primary indicator
const isPremium = paidTokens > 0 ||
                 profile.is_premium === true ||
                 profile.is_paid === true ||
                 profile.current_tier === 'premium'

// Automatically fixes flags if tokens exist but flags not set
if (isPremium && paidTokens > 0) {
  await ensurePremiumFlagsSet(userId, paidTokens, tier);
}
```

### 2. Database Migration - Complete Fix

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251031225618_fix_premium_access_complete.sql`

**Key Components**:

#### A. Comprehensive Sync Trigger
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_sync_premium_status
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF paid_tokens_balance, tokens_balance, is_premium, is_paid, current_tier
  ON profiles
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_premium_status();
```

This trigger:
- Fires BEFORE any change to token balances or premium flags
- Automatically sets `is_premium = true`, `is_paid = true` when user has paid tokens
- Sets appropriate tier based on token amount:
  - 10M+ tokens → `ultra-premium`
  - 5M+ tokens → `premium`
  - Any paid tokens → `budget`
- Syncs user to `paid_tier_users` or `free_tier_users` table
- Removes from opposite tier table

#### B. Emergency Retroactive Fix
- Scans all existing profiles for users with paid tokens
- Fixes premium flags for all affected users
- Populates `paid_tier_users` table for paying customers
- Provides statistics on how many users were fixed

#### C. Manual Fix Function
```sql
SELECT fix_user_premium_status('user-id-here');
```

For support/admin use to manually fix specific user accounts.

### 3. Updated AIModelSelector Component

**Changes**:
- Removed dependency on old `premiumAccessService`
- Now uses `getUnifiedPremiumStatus()`
- Removed Supabase `useAuth` import (was causing conflict)
- Uses Firebase Auth exclusively through the unified service
- Refresh button now forces immediate cache clear and recheck

### 4. Token Purchase Handler

**File**: `src/lib/tokenPurchaseHandler.ts`

Ensures every token purchase:
1. Updates `paid_tokens_balance` in profiles
2. Sets `is_premium = true`
3. Sets `is_paid = true`
4. Sets `current_tier` appropriately
5. Syncs to `paid_tier_users` table
6. Removes from `free_tier_users` table
7. Records purchase in `token_purchases` table
8. Clears all caches

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

The migration will run automatically on next deployment, but you can also run it manually:

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or execute via Supabase dashboard SQL editor
```

The migration will:
- Create the new trigger system
- Fix ALL existing users with paid tokens
- Report statistics on fixed users

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

Check migration output for:
```
✅ Fixed N users with premium access
Mismatched Records (should be 0): 0
```

### Step 3: Test Premium Access

1. Log in as a user with paid tokens
2. Open AI Model Selector dropdown
3. Click the refresh button
4. Verify premium models are unlocked
5. Check console logs for:
   ```
   ✅✅✅ [UNIFIED PREMIUM] USER HAS PREMIUM ACCESS ✅✅✅
   ```

### Step 4: Manual Fix (if needed)

If specific users still have issues:

```sql
-- Check user status
SELECT id, email, paid_tokens_balance, is_premium, is_paid, current_tier
FROM profiles
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Manual fix
SELECT fix_user_premium_status('user-firebase-id');

-- Verify fix
SELECT * FROM paid_tier_users WHERE id = 'user-firebase-id';
```

## Verification Queries

### Check System Health
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_users,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE paid_tokens_balance > 0) as users_with_tokens,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE paid_tokens_balance > 0 AND is_premium = true) as properly_flagged,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE paid_tokens_balance > 0 AND is_premium != true) as broken
FROM profiles;
```

### Check Specific User
```sql
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.email,
  p.paid_tokens_balance,
  p.is_premium,
  p.is_paid,
  p.current_tier,
  CASE WHEN pt.id IS NOT NULL THEN 'YES' ELSE 'NO' END as in_paid_tier_table
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN paid_tier_users pt ON p.id = pt.id
WHERE p.email = 'user@example.com';
```

## Monitoring Going Forward

### Console Logs to Watch

Premium access checks now log:
```
🔐 [UNIFIED PREMIUM] Starting premium check
📊 [UNIFIED PREMIUM] Profile data:
   Paid Tokens: 10000000
   is_premium: true
   is_paid: true
   current_tier: ultra-premium
✅✅✅ [UNIFIED PREMIUM] USER HAS PREMIUM ACCESS ✅✅✅
```

If you see:
```
🔒🔒🔒 [UNIFIED PREMIUM] FREE TIER USER 🔒🔒🔒
```

But user should be premium, run the manual fix function.

### Automated Health Check

Add to cron/scheduled job:
```sql
-- Run daily to catch any sync issues
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as broken_premium_users
FROM profiles
WHERE paid_tokens_balance > 0
  AND (is_premium IS NOT TRUE OR is_paid IS NOT TRUE);
```

If result > 0, investigate and run retroactive fix.

## Key Improvements

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One service, one way to check premium status
2. **Self-Healing**: System automatically fixes flags when tokens detected
3. **Trigger-Based**: Changes propagate automatically, no manual sync needed
4. **Retroactive Fix**: All existing broken accounts fixed by migration
5. **Consistent Auth**: Uses Firebase Auth exclusively, no Supabase conflict
6. **Better Caching**: 10-second unified cache, cleared on purchase
7. **Comprehensive Logging**: Easy to debug and monitor

## Support Commands

```sql
-- Count affected users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles WHERE paid_tokens_balance > 0;

-- Fix all users
DO $$
DECLARE v_user text;
BEGIN
  FOR v_user IN SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE paid_tokens_balance > 0 LOOP
    PERFORM fix_user_premium_status(v_user);
  END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Check trigger status
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'trigger_sync_premium_status';

-- Force sync single user
SELECT sync_premium_status() FROM profiles WHERE id = 'user-id';
```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive fix addresses all identified root causes:

1. ✅ Unified authentication (Firebase only)
2. ✅ Single premium check service
3. ✅ Automatic flag synchronization
4. ✅ Database trigger system
5. ✅ Retroactive fix for existing users

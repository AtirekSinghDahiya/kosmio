## 🚀 Quick Start - 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Get Your API Keys (Required)

Visit these sites and get your API keys:

| Provider | Where to Get | Required? |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Groq** | https://console.groq.com/keys | ⭐ **Free & Required** |
| OpenAI | https://platform.openai.com/api-keys | Recommended |
| Claude | https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys | Recommended |
| Gemini | https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey | Optional |
| HeyGen | https://app.heygen.com/settings/api | For video generation |
| ElevenLabs | https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys | For voiceovers |

**Tip**: Start with Groq (it's FREE!), add others later.

### Step 2: Update `.env` File

Open `.env` and replace the placeholder values:

```bash
# Replace these lines with your actual keys:
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE
VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza-YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE  # ⭐ START WITH THIS!
VITE_HEYGEN_API_KEY=YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE
VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE
```

**Leave Firebase and Supabase keys as they are - they're already configured!**

---

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Via GitHub (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Kroniq AI"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kroniq-ai.git
git push -u origin main

# 2. Go to vercel.com/new
# 3. Import your repository
# 4. Add environment variables (copy from VERCEL_ENV_VARS.txt)
# 5. Deploy!
```

#### Option B: Via CLI (Quick)
```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Login and deploy
vercel login
vercel

# 3. Add environment variables
vercel env add VITE_GROQ_API_KEY production
# (paste your key)

# 4. Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

**That's it! Your app will be live in 2-3 minutes!**

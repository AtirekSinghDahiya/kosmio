## 🔍 What Was Wrong (Summary)

### The Core Problem
```
User purchases tokens
    ↓
paid_tokens_balance = 10000000 ✅  (Stored correctly)
is_premium = NULL ❌               (Flag NOT set)
is_paid = NULL ❌                  (Flag NOT set)
current_tier = 'free' ❌           (Wrong tier)
paid_tier_users table: NO RECORD ❌ (Not synced)
    ↓
Premium check looks at flags, not balance
    ↓
Models stay locked 🔒
```

### 10 Root Causes Found
1. Dual authentication system (Firebase + Supabase)
2. 4 different premium check services
3. Flags not synced with token balance
4. Missing paid_tier_users records
5. RLS blocking Firebase users
6. Lock logic checked wrong data
7. Purchase handler incomplete
8. Triggers not firing
9. Cache conflicts
10. No retroactive fix

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Files Created
1. `src/lib/unifiedPremiumAccess.ts` - Single source of truth
2. `src/lib/tokenPurchaseHandler.ts` - Complete purchase flow

---

## 🛠️ Technical Changes

### Database
- New trigger on `profiles` table
- Auto-sets `is_premium`, `is_paid`, `current_tier` based on balance
- Auto-syncs to `paid_tier_users` table
- Retroactive fix for all existing users

### Frontend
- Unified premium access service
- Removed dual auth conflict
- Single 10-second cache
- Better error handling

### Purchase Flow
- Comprehensive token purchase handler
- Sets all flags correctly
- Records transaction
- Clears caches

---

## 📊 Verification

### Database Check
```sql
-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles
WHERE paid_tokens_balance > 0
AND is_premium IS NOT TRUE;
```

### Manual Fix (if needed)
```sql
SELECT fix_user_premium_status('user-firebase-id');
```

---

## 🚨 Emergency Contacts

### If Models Still Locked
1. Check console for errors
2. Run manual fix SQL (see QUICK_FIX_GUIDE_V2.md)
3. Verify trigger is active
4. Check RLS is disabled on tier tables

### If Many Users Affected
See `QUICK_FIX_GUIDE_V2.md` - Section "Support Script"

## 🎓 Key Lessons

1. **Never separate data from its status flags** - They must stay in sync
2. **One auth system only** - Two auth systems = chaos
3. **Single source of truth** - Multiple check services = problems
4. **Triggers are essential** - Manual sync will be forgotten
5. **Fix the past** - New code must repair old data

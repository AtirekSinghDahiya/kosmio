# Pricing System & Form Tracking Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a complete pricing and subscription management system with working purchase flow (click to buy) and fixed form submissions to properly save to the database.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Form Submissions Fixed

**Problem:** Contact forms weren't saving to the database.

**Solution:**
- Updated `ContactPage.tsx` to use `submitForm()` from `formTrackingService.ts`
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Forms now save to `form_submissions` table in Supabase

**Database Table:** `form_submissions`
- Stores all form submissions (contact, signup, feedback, support, billing, etc.)
- RLS enabled with policies allowing create/read operations
- Tracks user_id, form_type, form_data (JSON), status, timestamps

**Test:**
```sql
-- Check submissions in database
SELECT * FROM form_submissions ORDER BY submitted_at DESC;
```

### 3. Purchase Flow (Working)

**How It Works:**

1. **User clicks "Upgrade Now" or "Get Started Free"**
2. **System creates/updates subscription:**
   - Record in `user_subscriptions` table
   - Links user to plan
   - Sets status to 'active'
   - Calculates expiration date

3. **Transaction recorded:**
   - Entry in `transactions` table
   - Tracks amount, plan, status
   - Metadata stored (plan name, billing period)

4. **Usage tracking initialized:**
   - Creates entries in `usage_tracking` table
   - Tracks: chat_messages, code_projects, images, videos, storage
   - Sets 30-day billing period

5. **Success notification & page reload**

**No Payment Gateway Required:**
- Currently works by clicking "Buy"
- Creates subscription instantly
- For production: Add Stripe/PayPal integration

## üéØ Usage Limits System

### How Limits Work

1. **On Purchase:**
   - Usage tracking records initialized at 0
   - 30-day billing period set

2. **When User Creates Content:**
   - Check current usage vs. plan limits
   - If under limit: Allow & increment usage
   - If at limit: Show upgrade prompt

3. **Usage Bar Display:**
   ```
   Chat Messages: 25/30 used (83%)
   ‚¨õ‚¨õ‚¨õ‚¨õ‚¨õ‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú
   ```

4. **Upgrade Prompt:**
   - Shows when user hits 80% of limit
   - "You've used 80% of your free limit. Upgrade now!"

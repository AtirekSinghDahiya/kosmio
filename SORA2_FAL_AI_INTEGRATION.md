# Sora 2 Integration via Fal.ai - Complete Guide

## 🎉 Sora 2 is NOW AVAILABLE!

We've successfully integrated OpenAI Sora 2 video generation using Fal.ai's API service.

## What is Fal.ai?

Fal.ai is a service that provides easy API access to advanced AI models, including OpenAI's Sora 2. Instead of waiting for OpenAI to release the API publicly, you can use Fal.ai to access Sora 2 right now.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your Fal.ai API Key

1. Visit https://fal.ai
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with something like `fal-...`)

### 2. Add to Your .env File

Open your `.env` file and add:

```bash
# Fal.ai API Key (for Sora 2 Video Generation)
VITE_FAL_KEY=your-fal-api-key-here
```

Replace `your-fal-api-key-here` with your actual Fal.ai API key.

### 3. Restart Dev Server

Stop and restart your development server for the changes to take effect.

## Features

### Supported Options

- **Resolution**: 720p (high quality)
- **Aspect Ratios**:
  - 16:9 (landscape)
  - 9:16 (portrait/mobile)
- **Durations**:
  - 4 seconds
  - 8 seconds
  - 12 seconds (new!)

### Video Quality

Sora 2 generates extremely high-quality, realistic videos with:
- Natural motion and physics
- Accurate lip-syncing (when applicable)
- Cinematic lighting and camera work
- Realistic sound and atmosphere
- Smooth transitions and movements

## How It Works

### 1. Request Submission
When you generate a video, the app:
1. Sends your prompt to Fal.ai's Sora 2 endpoint
2. Receives a request ID
3. Shows you the contextual loading animation

### 2. Video Generation
Fal.ai/Sora 2:
1. Processes your text prompt
2. Generates the video frames
3. Renders the final video
4. Uploads to storage

### 3. Polling & Completion
The app:
1. Checks status every 5 seconds
2. Updates progress bar
3. Downloads video when complete
4. Automatically saves to your projects

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints

```typescript
// Submit video generation
POST https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/sora-2/text-to-video

// Check status
GET https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/sora-2/text-to-video/requests/{requestId}/status

// Get result
GET https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/sora-2/text-to-video/requests/{requestId}
```

### Request Format

```typescript
{
  prompt: "Your video description",
  resolution: "720p",
  aspect_ratio: "16:9" | "9:16",
  duration: 4 | 8 | 12
}
```

### Response Format

```typescript
{
  video: {
    url: "https://storage.googleapis.com/...",
    content_type: "video/mp4",
    width: 1280,

    fps: 30,
    duration: 4
  },
  video_id: "video_123"
}
```

Prices may vary based on your account tier and usage.

## Writing Great Prompts

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**
   - Bad: "A person walking"
   - Good: "A woman in her 30s walking down a quiet suburban street at sunset"

2. **Include Camera Details**
   - Camera angles (close-up, wide shot, over-the-shoulder)
   - Camera movements (slow pan, tracking shot, static)
   - Lighting (golden hour, dramatic shadows, soft natural light)

3. **Describe Motion**
   - Character movements
   - Environmental elements (leaves blowing, water flowing)
   - Speed and pacing

4. **Add Atmosphere**
   - Time of day
   - Weather conditions
   - Sound suggestions (though Sora 2 doesn't generate audio)

### Example Prompts

**Good Prompt 1:**
```
A dramatic Hollywood breakup scene at dusk on a quiet suburban street.
A man and a woman in their 30s face each other, speaking softly but
emotionally, lips syncing to breakup dialogue. Cinematic lighting,
warm sunset tones, shallow depth of field, gentle breeze moving
autumn leaves, realistic natural sound, no background music
```

**Good Prompt 2:**
```
Close-up shot of a barista's hands carefully pouring steamed milk
into a cappuccino, creating intricate latte art. Morning light
streams through a café window, highlighting the coffee's rich brown
tones. Slow motion capture at 120fps, shallow depth of field,
professional food photography style
```

**Good Prompt 3:**
```
Drone footage flying over a misty mountain valley at sunrise.
Camera slowly rises and pans across pine forests below, revealing
a winding river cutting through the landscape. Soft morning fog
clings to the valleys, golden sunlight breaking through clouds.
Smooth, cinematic camera movement, 4K quality
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Fal.ai API key is not configured"

**Solution**:
1. Check `.env` file has `VITE_FAL_KEY=your-key-here`
2. Make sure there are no extra spaces
3. Restart dev server

### "Generation Failed"

**Possible causes:**
1. Invalid API key - verify at https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys
2. No credits - check your Fal.ai account balance
3. Rate limit - wait a few minutes and try again
4. Prompt too long - keep prompts under 500 words

### "Video generation timed out"

This is rare but can happen if:
1. Fal.ai servers are overloaded
2. Your prompt is extremely complex
3. Network connectivity issues

**Solution**: Try again with a simpler prompt

### Video Quality Issues

If generated video quality is not what you expected:
1. Use more detailed prompts
2. Specify camera angles and lighting
3. Mention quality keywords ("cinematic", "4K", "professional")
4. Try different aspect ratios

## Comparison: Sora 2 vs Veo-3 vs HeyGen

| Feature | Sora 2 (Fal.ai) | Veo-3 (AIMLAPI) | HeyGen |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Type** | Text-to-video | Text-to-video | Avatar videos |
| **Quality** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Realism** | Extremely high | Very high | Good (avatars) |
| **Speed** | Moderate (30-60s) | Fast (15-30s) | Fast (20-40s) |
| **Cost** | Medium | Low | Medium |
| **Best For** | Realistic scenes | Fast generation | Talking heads |
| **Limitations** | No audio | Needs verification | Avatar-only |

## Integration Code

The integration is already complete in your project!

**Service File**: `src/lib/falSoraService.ts`
**Component**: `src/components/Chat/VideoGenerator.tsx`

### Key Functions

```typescript
// Check if available
isFalSoraAvailable(): boolean

// Generate video (with polling)
createAndPollFalSoraVideo(
  request: FalSoraRequest,
  onProgress?: (status: string, percent: number) => void
): Promise<string>

// Submit request
submitFalSoraRequest(request: FalSoraRequest): Promise<string>

// Check status
checkFalSoraStatus(requestId: string): Promise<FalQueueStatus>

// Get result
getFalSoraResult(requestId: string): Promise<FalSoraVideo>
```

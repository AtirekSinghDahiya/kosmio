# Premium Model Access - Fix Summary

## Problem
Users with 10,000,000 tokens displayed in UI could not access premium AI models. All premium models remained locked.

## Root Cause
Users had `paid_tokens_balance = 10000000` in database but premium status flags (`is_premium`, `is_paid`, `current_tier`) were not set. Premium check looked at flags, not balance.

## Solution
Created comprehensive fix with:
1. ✅ Unified premium access service (single source of truth)
2. ✅ Database trigger (auto-syncs flags with token balance)
3. ✅ Retroactive migration (fixes all existing users)
4. ✅ Token purchase handler (ensures future purchases work)
5. ✅ Updated AI model selector (uses new unified check)

## Files Changed
